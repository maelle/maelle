### Bonjour, I'm MaÃ«lle! :wave:

I am a R(esearch) Software Engineer, part-time with [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) where I, among other things, maintain the guide [rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/). 
I also created the [R-hub blog](https://blog.r-hub.io) and co-wrote the online book [HTTP testing in R](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing) with Scott Chamberlain. 
I regularly contract for various organizations, including research institutions, for developing or strengthening R packages. 
I have a PhD in Statistics. I live in Nancy, France.
